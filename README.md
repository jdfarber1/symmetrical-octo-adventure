# Coffee Rotation

Coffee Rotation is a simple Java program that helps manage the rotation of coffee expenses among a group of coworkers. It calculates each person's net contribution and determines who should pay for the day.

## Assumptions:

Bob always orders a cappuccino, and its cost is hardcoded at $3 (can be changed).
Net contribution is calculated as the total spent minus personal drink cost.
The same five coworkers are the only ones in the group order.

### Data Entry:

User will be prompted for the price of each person's drink (besides Bob)
Bob's drink cost is automatically added.
The user will have the option to reset the program, otherwise, each person's expenses will be cumulative
